                    <p><h2><i>Nations worldwide are confronting climate change and recognizing that building decarbonization is a significant component of their efforts. The worldwide building sector accounts for about 40% of energy-related carbon emissions and the global building stock is predicted to double by the year 2060.

                        Buildings remain a key sector that lacks sufficient climate change mitigation policies. It is our duty to recognize that our long-standing initiatives in energy efficiency should include greenhouse gas emission reductions based on a holistic analysis including healthy, safe, and comfortable environments; energy efficiency; environmental impacts; sustainability; operational security; and economics.</i></h2></p>

                        <p><h2><i>You’ve probably heard by now that “the future is electric”: out with the gas furnaces and water heaters, in with energy-efficient electric vehicles (EVs) and induction stoves. And that transformation away from fossil fuels and toward a greener tomorrow can’t come soon enough. To put a point on it, we need to decarbonize everything from our homes to the power grid in order to hit net-zero emissions by 2050. So far, this is one of the best ways to help keep global warming to no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius and rein in the worst of climate change. For instance, use of Electric Vehicles (EVs) as they have a lower carbon footprint in comparison to vehicles using conventional fuels like petrol, diesel. </i></h2></p>

                    <br><p><h2>Global warming, also known as climate change, is the observed century-scale rise in the average temperature of the Earth’s climate system and its related effects. Carbon dioxide and other such gases trap the Sun’s heat and keep the Earth warm, resulting in climate change.

                        Emission of greenhouse gases such as methane, carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, etc, has been the main cause of this disastrous climate change, unbeneficial for humans as well as other living organisms residing on Earth. It has been predicted that during the 21st century, the global surface temperature is likely to rise a further 0.3 to 1.70 C / 0.5 to 2.10F when the emissions are the lowest; when the emissions are high, temperature can rise from 2.6 to 4.80C / 4.7 to 8.60F.
                        
                        WHAT ARE THE EFFECTS OF GLOBAL WARMING?
                        
                        Global warming has numerous and adverse effects on the environment of our planet, out of which many impacts on climate change have already been observed like glacier retreat, change in agriculture yield and changes in the timing of seasonal events such as early flowering of plants, etc.
                        
                        Other effects include:
                        
                        Rising sea levels can lead to coastal flooding.
                        Severe droughts in dry areas.
                        Early snowmelt, melting of glaciers and severe droughts can lead to water shortage, which in turn increases the risk of wildfires.
                        Higher levels of air pollution.
                        Spread of allergies, asthma, etc.
                        Depletion of Earth’s ozone layer.
                        WHAT CAN WE DO TO FURTHER PREVENT GLOBAL WARMING?
                        
                        The effects of global warming are horrifying, aren’t they? Here are ways you can prevent it:
                        
                        Cycle/walk short distances. It is good for your health too.
                        Use catalytic converters in an automobile; they filter all the pollutants emitted from your vehicle.
                        Use better bulbs. Eg: LED bulbs
                        Save electricity; coal is burnt to produce it.
                        Use energy-efficient appliances.
                        Minimize the use of refrigerator and air conditioner; they emit CFC (Cloro Floro Carbon), which depletes our ozone layer.
                        Use solar energy.<i></i>
